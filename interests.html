<h3>Athletics</h3>
<p>
My love for athletics stemmed from my love for running. Running was always apart of my life. I practically grew up in it. As a child I was always running around with my dog. When I was in primary school, one of my teachers decide it would be a nice idea to do races. You were automatically entered into every race, as the way of country schools.  I hadn't considered this much except for the fact I'd get a day off school. There was two main races, a sprint and then a cross country race. I ran in the girls race and won both of the races.  I went home to my mother, an ex athlete, and she was estatic. To tis day, my medals still hand in the livingroom. She found out about my parish athletics club and insisted I started. 
</p>

<p>
Now I was in an athletics club, training twice a week.  In my club as seen as we didn't have a lot of people, we were made to train for everything.  However my favourites were sprints, cross country and long jump. I started going to community games, sometimes it would lead to Lenisters.  I loved every second of it. Suddenly, I started doing real races, 5ks and 10ks. When I was twelve, my club signed me up to do hurdles, not the small little ones you see in primary schools, but the big ones you see Brianna Rollins-McNeal jumping.  It was terrifying.  I still remember jumping then and on my fourth ones, my foot caught it ever so slightly and I was waiting to hear it fallbehind me.  A girl two lanes over from me fell on the second last one.  All i could do was continue running.  I came first and my love for hurdles blossomed. Sadly, my athletics club couldnt afford to get big hurdles, but I could still compete. 
</p>
<p>
My favourite athlete is without a doubt Usain Bolt. Bolt is a 33 year old former spirnter from Jamaica.  He is a world record holder in the 100 metres, 200 metres and 4 Ã— 100 metres relay. Owing to his achievements and dominance in sprint competition, he is widely considered to be the greatest sprinter of all time. I remember being at a house party for his last proffessional sprint.  \i begged the guy who owned the house to let me watch it on the tv. The astmosphere was hectic.  You could see all these other sprinters stretching  tensly, waiting for the race to begin, as the crowd started singing "I'm gonna be (500 miles)" by the Proclaimers as Bolt cheered them on.  Sadly, Bolt didn't win the race, he came in third to Justin Gatlin and Christian Coleman, two American sprinters. Between 16 August 2008 and 19 August 2016, Usain Bolt won 20 Olympic and world championship gold medals in the 21 events he entered, a staggering tally that makes him the greatest sprinter of all time. He will always remain one of my idols.

When I was in my second year of secondary school, I made the decision to quit athletics. It was something  was debating for a while and it ended up being a good choice for me. However, two years later I started running again. It was difficult at first as I was used to being able to go for long distance runs when i was twelve and not have to stop, but here I was as a sixteen year old attempting it and not being up to par with my old self.  I built up my distance over time.  I still dont compete in races any more but just do it as a way to clear my head and get fit.  I go to the mardyke gym twice a week and destress on the treadmill.  I will always love running, and who knows? Maybe one day I'll go back to it properly.

<h3>Travel</h3>
<p>
I loving travelling and seeing different places, cultures and people.  In my opinion, it is one of the most interesting things a person can do. I started travelling when I was very young. Yearly summer holidays were a tradition in my family. My mother always  said she needed to get away to have a real holiday, while my dad always insisted he would rather stay at home, even though he always seemed to throughly enjoy it. 
</p>
<p>
The first place I ever went to was a small town in Spain by the coast of the mediterranean sea called Calpe. Our Aunt lived there for the majority of her life so we would visit her every summer. Calpe's known for it's sandy beaches and The Penyal de Ifach. The Penyal d'Ifac is a massive limestone outcrop emerging from the sea and linked to the shore by rock debris. Rising to 332 metres high, the rock is a striking visual feature of the Mediterranean coastline. Behind Penyal d'Ifac is a large lagoon cut off from the sea by strips of sandy beach and extending inland to the coastal mountains. The wetland area around the lagoon is all that remains of the formerly much more extensive wetlands of the Marina Alta. It was one of our holiday traditions to climb this huge rock.  My dad still boasts about the time when I was three and he carried me the whole way up. The town also holds a rich spanish culture which tends to pull in various tourists to this charistic seatown.

One of the holidays I ventured on was to Holland. we sent a week in Zanvoort, a town on the nortern coast in a center parcs resort.  However, the highlight of the holiday was going to amsterdam.  We stayed in a hotel in the inner city and definitely had the whole tourist holiday.  We went to see Ann Frank's house.  I had read her book a few years prior and it was extremely interesting to have a proper idea of how she lived.  Sadly, the attic in the annex was sectioned off from tourists and you werent allowed up.  It was stll an incredibly interestng destination.  We also went to see the Van Gogh Museum.  To becompletely honest, I'm not an incredibly artistic person but I always found the story of Van Goghs life fascinating. We also went on one of those tourist boat rides were they tell you about the infrastructure of the city, my dad's idea.  They explained the buildings in the city and their architectural history. For our last venture into the city, we attended Madame Tussauds wax museum, which was fun to see the likeness of these wax figures to who they were actually based upon. 
</p>
<p>
Despite having travelling to multiple countries in my past, I still have a thirst to travel aand learn more about the broad world we live in.  I hope to be able to go back packing around Europe and get my J1 to go to America. There is so much to see and I want to see as much as possible.

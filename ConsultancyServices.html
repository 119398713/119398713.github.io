<h3>●  Hyperautomation</h3>
<p>
As defined by Gartner, hyper-automation “deals with the application of advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), to increasingly automate processes and augment humans. Hyper-automation extends across a range of tools that can be automated, but also refers to the sophistication of the automation (i.e., discover, analyse, design, automate, measure, monitor, reassess.)”

<h3>●  Multiexperience</h3>
<p>
Multiexperience is a concept pioneered by Gartner late in 2019. The concept is being championed as one of the biggest developments for 2020. In fact, Gartner states that “more than 25% of the mobile apps, progressive web apps and conversational apps at large enterprises will be built and/or run through a multiexperience development platform” by 2023.
</p>
<p>
In short, multiexperience is about adapting to the increasing market of different devices and their respective experiences. Applications now need to run on different platforms and adapt easily, all while providing a consistent experience from a business perspective.

<h3>●  Distributed Cloud</h3>
<p>
Industry experts believe that together, edge computing and distributed cloud improve the user experience of a network. While these technologies are related, they are distinct and unique.
</p>
<p>
A distributed cloud refers to having computation, storage, and networking in a micro-cloud located outside the centralized cloud. Examples of a distributed cloud include both fog computing and edge computing. Establishing a distributed cloud situates computing closer to the end user, providing decreased latency and opportunities for increased security. Potential security solutions include a blockchain-based security architecture or random auditing of data to check for integrity. A distributed cloud also processes data in real-time.

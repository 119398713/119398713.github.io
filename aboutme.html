I'm 18 years old. I am a full time UCC student, studying Business information systems (BIS) as a first 
year student. I choice this course because  have always had an interest in business, as it was one of my favourite subjects in secondary school.  I always had an interest in computers, however there were never any opportunities to investigate this interest in my area.

I am a student at UCC, studying Business information systems.  I am in my first year of college.  The experience with college so far has taught me the value of indepence and maturity. I have learned important skills such a coding in multiple languages and learning the basic jargon of many  different sections in the world of business. These skills will help me in the future when I enter the busiiness world.  My course is interesting in the sense that I get to learn about both business and information systems.  I always had an interest in technology but never got to act on it as my past environment never offered such an oppertunity for me. I, however, studying business in secondary school from first year all the way to leaving cert.
